# FRUSCrawler
A rather primitive web crawler based on Python that is designed to crawl US Office of the Historian and its FRUS webpages.

**Current features:**
- Set crawl target webpage within the FRUS website
- Designate year upper and lower bounds
- Debug mode
- Loading bar (crawler is slow, so this will show you if the process is hanging)

**Recent Changes:**
- Added random delays between each call to host (ethical crawling concerns)
- Added user agent information

Read.me under construction, will get around to it.

Most instructions are coded as comments in the python file.

Meanwhile, contact khyrst@korea.ac.kr for unresolved issues.
