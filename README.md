# FRUSCrawler
A rather primitive web crawler based on Python that is designed to crawl US Office of the Historian and its FRUS webpages.

Current features:
- Set crawl target webpage
- Designate year upper and lower bounds
- Debug mode
- Loading bar (crawler is slow, so this will show you if the process is hanging)

Read.me under construction, will get around to it.
Most instructions are coded as comments in the python file.
Meanwhile, contact khyrst@korea.ac.kr for unresolved issues.
